# Text-Messenger-with-AES
This is a small fork of the [text messenger](https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Text-Messenger) to learn how to use the pycryptodome library. Before running, you need to change ```HOST_IP``` to server IP and ```key``` to make the encryption work (it must be the same for all clients)

# Requirements:
- pycryptodome
